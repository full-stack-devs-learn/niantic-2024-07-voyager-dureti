Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:

        -- getArea() method does not handle cases where the width or height is zero or negative

        Where was the bug? (function, line number):

        -- getArea() method, starting at line 40-42

        What test helped you find the bug?

        --etArea_shouldReturn_zeroWhenWidthIsNegative()

        What did you do to fix the bug?

        --added a conditional statement to getArea() method to check if either width or height is zero or less.
        If this condition is met, the method now correctly returns 0

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:

        -- getPerimeter() is incorrectly calculating the perimeter of the rectangle.
        It returns the sum of width and height, but the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is
        2 * (width + height).

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)

        -- getPerimeter() method, line 55 the return statement

        What test helped you find the bug?

        -- getPerimeter_shouldReturn_twoTimesTheSumOfWidthAndLength()

        What did you do to fix the bug?

        -- update the return statement in the getPerimeter() method to return 2 * (width + height) instead of width + height



Class: Quiz

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:

        -- getPercent() not correctly calculating the percentage as it is always returning zero

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)

        -- method getPercent() is supposed to return a percentage, but the return type of the method is int.
        The calculation inside getPercent() involves dividing score by possiblePoints, both of which are integers.
        This will result in integer division, potentially losing the fractional part of the percentage.

        What test helped you find the bug?

        -- getPercent_shouldReturn_correctPercentage_WhenScoreIsPositive_AndPossiblePointsIsPositive()

        What did you do to fix the bug?

        --  cast the score or possiblePoints to double before performing the division
            and after cast it back to int to return the percentage as an integer value.

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        -- getPercent() does not handle the case where score might be less than 0

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)

        -- getPercent() method line 28-31

        What test helped you find the bug?

        -- getPercent_shouldReturn_zeroWhenScoreIsNegative()

        What did you do to fix the bug?

        -- added a condition at the beginning of the getPercent() method to check if score is negative to returns 0

    Bug 3:

            Describe the bug/error:
            -- getPercent() does not handle the case where possiblePoints might be less than 0

            Where was the bug? (function, line number)

            -- getPercent() method line 28-31

            What test helped you find the bug?
            getPercent_shouldReturn_zeroWhenPossiblePointsIsNegative()

            What did you do to fix the bug?
            -- added a condition at the beginning of the getPercent() method to check if possiblePoints is negative to returns 0
    Bug 4:

            Describe the bug/error:

            -- getLetterGrade() method incorrectly returns "B" when score is 90 and possiblePoints set to 100

            Where was the bug? (function, line number)

            -- getLetterGrade() method line 38 if statement

            What test helped you find the bug?

            -- getLetterGrade_shouldReturn_A_WhenPercentIs90_OrGreater()

            What did you do to fix the bug?

            -- modified the condition in the getLetterGrade() method to use >= instead of >
    Bug 5:

                Describe the bug/error:

                -- getLetterGrade() method incorrectly returns "C" when score is 80 and possiblePoints set to 100

                Where was the bug? (function, line number)

                -- getLetterGrade() method line 39 else if statement

                What test helped you find the bug?

                -- getLetterGrade_shouldReturn_B_WhenPercentIs80_OrGreater()

                What did you do to fix the bug?

                -- modified the condition in the getLetterGrade() method to use >= instead of >

    Bug 6:

                    Describe the bug/error:

                    -- getLetterGrade() method incorrectly returns "D" when score is 70 and possiblePoints set to 100

                    Where was the bug? (function, line number)

                    -- getLetterGrade() method line 40 else if statement

                    What test helped you find the bug?

                    -- getLetterGrade_shouldReturn_B_WhenPercentIs70_OrGreater()

                    What did you do to fix the bug?

                    -- modified the condition in the getLetterGrade() method to use >= instead of >
    Bug 7:

                        Describe the bug/error:

                        -- getLetterGrade() method incorrectly returns "D" when score is 51 and possiblePoints set to 100

                        Where was the bug? (function, line number)

                        -- getLetterGrade() method line 41 else if statement

                        What test helped you find the bug?

                        -- getLetterGrade_shouldReturn_F_WhenPercentIsBelow60()

                        What did you do to fix the bug?

                        -- replaced the condition in the getLetterGrade() method else if(percent > 50) to else if(percent >= 60) and return "D"
